Shopping trends analysis
This project explores shopping patterns, customer behavior and purchasing trends using analytics and visualization techniques. The goal is to uncover insights that can help businesses understand consumer habits, optimise product offerings and improve decision making. This is done by detecting trends across product categories, demographics and time periods and by visualisation using Google Looker dashboards for clearer insights.
